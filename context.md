# Project Context

This file tracks high-level changes and OSS adjustments.

## OSS Readiness (2025-07-21)

- Sanitized all docs to use example domains and placeholders
- Removed dev-only temp files (`lint_errors.txt`)
- Added OSS meta files: LICENSE (MIT), CODE_OF_CONDUCT, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY
- Rewrote git history to remove hard-coded API keys and client IDs
- Ensured `.gitignore` blocks `.env`, `.dev.vars`, and keys
